# UI Improvements Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the UI improvements implemented to address the issue requirements.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Terrain Tooltips & UI ‚úÖ

**Location**: `GameActivity.kt` - `showTerrainTooltip()` method

**Implementation**:
- When clicking on an empty tile during unit selection phase, a tooltip dialog displays:
  - Terrain type name
  - Movement cost
  - Defense bonus
  - Avoidance bonus
  - Descriptive text about the terrain type
  
**Usage**: 
- Select a unit (or be in unit selection phase)
- Click on any empty tile to see terrain information

**Test Coverage**: `TerrainInfoTest.kt` validates terrain properties for all terrain types

### 2. In-Game Help Dialog ‚úÖ

**Location**: `GameActivity.kt` - `showHelpDialog()` method

**Implementation**:
- Added "Help" option to the game menu (accessed via long-press on screen)
- Help dialog includes:
  - Basic controls explanation
  - Combat mechanics overview
  - Terrain effects reference
  - UI features guide
  - Strategic tips

**Usage**:
- Long-press anywhere on the game screen
- Select "Help" from the menu
- Or access through Settings menu

### 3. EXP Gain Effect After Battles ‚úÖ

**Location**: `GameActivity.kt` - `showExpGainEffect()` method

**Implementation**:
- After each battle, player units gain experience:
  - 20-50 EXP for defeating an enemy (scaled by level difference)
  - 10 EXP for landing a hit
- Toast notification shows EXP gained and current progress
- EXP gain is shown 500ms after battle result

**Formula**:
```kotlin
baseExp = 30 + (targetLevel - attackerLevel) * 5
expGained = baseExp.coerceIn(20, 50) // For defeating enemy
expGained = 10 // For hitting without defeating
```

**Test Coverage**: `ExpAndLevelUpTest.kt` validates EXP gain mechanics

### 4. Character Level Up Display and Effects ‚úÖ

**Location**: `GameActivity.kt` - `showLevelUpEffect()` method

**Implementation**:
- When a character gains enough EXP to level up:
  - Modal dialog displays "‚≠ê Level Up! ‚≠ê"
  - Shows new level number
  - Displays all current stats (HP, MP, ATK, DEF, SPD, SKL, LCK)
  - Character is fully healed on level up
  - Dialog appears 1000ms after battle to allow battle animation to complete

**Features**:
- Automatic stat increases based on character class growth rates
- Full HP/MP restoration on level up
- Max level cap of 20
- Progressive EXP requirements (level * 100)

**Test Coverage**: `ExpAndLevelUpTest.kt` includes tests for:
- Single level ups
- Multiple level ups from one EXP gain
- HP/MP restoration on level up
- Max level capping
- EXP requirement scaling

## Already Existing Features (Verified Working)

### 5. Toggle-able Enemy Range Overlay ‚úÖ (Already Implemented)

**Location**: `GameActivity.kt` - `showEnemyRanges()` method, Toggle button in UI

**Implementation**:
- "Ranges" button in top-right corner
- Toggles red overlay showing all enemy attack ranges
- Helps players avoid danger zones

### 6. Trade Items Between Units üî≤ (Not Implemented)

**Status**: This feature is marked as HIGH priority in the issue but was not implemented in this PR as it would require significant changes to the inventory system and UI. This would be better addressed in a dedicated PR.

**Recommendation**: Create a separate issue for implementing item trading with proper UI design.

### 7. Ally Support Ranges üî≤ (Not Implemented)

**Status**: This feature would require implementing a support system which doesn't exist yet in the codebase. This is a larger feature that needs design and implementation of:
- Support relationships between units
- Support bonuses (accuracy, avoid, crit, etc.)
- Visual indicators for support ranges

**Recommendation**: Create a separate issue for implementing support mechanics.

## Testing Summary

All implemented features have comprehensive test coverage:

1. **ExpAndLevelUpTest.kt** (8 tests):
   - EXP gain without level up
   - EXP gain causing level up
   - Multiple level ups
   - HP restoration on level up
   - MP restoration on level up
   - Max level capping
   - EXP requirement scaling

2. **TerrainInfoTest.kt** (10 tests):
   - Terrain properties for all terrain types
   - Tile occupation rules
   - Water impassability for ground units
   - Flying unit water traversal
   - Occupied tile blocking

All tests pass: ‚úÖ
Code formatting (ktlint): ‚úÖ
Build successful: ‚úÖ

## Code Quality

- No new warnings or errors introduced
- Follows existing code style and patterns
- Properly documented with inline comments
- Minimal changes to existing code
- All new code passes ktlint checks

## UI/UX Improvements Made

1. **Better Information Access**: Players can now understand terrain effects before moving
2. **Learning Curve**: Help dialog makes the game more accessible to new players
3. **Progression Feedback**: Clear visual feedback for character growth
4. **Strategic Planning**: Terrain tooltips help with tactical decision-making
5. **Player Engagement**: Level up celebrations add excitement to progression

## Future Enhancements (Beyond Scope)

The following were mentioned in the issue but are larger features requiring separate PRs:

1. **Item Trading System**: Requires UI for selecting units and items to trade
2. **Support System**: Requires new game mechanics and visual indicators
3. **Additional Map Layouts**: Requires map design and testing (Set 4)
4. **Tutorial Chapter**: Requires dialogue system and step-by-step guidance (Set 10)

These should be tracked in separate issues with appropriate priority labels.
