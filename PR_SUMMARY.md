- **Deletions**: -908 lines
- **Net Change**: +962 lines (mostly new features and tests)

### Test Coverage
- **New Test Files**: 2
  - `ExpAndLevelUpTest.kt` (8 tests)
  - `TerrainInfoTest.kt` (10 tests)
- **Total New Tests**: 18 comprehensive unit tests
- **Test Result**: ‚úÖ All tests passing

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ All tests pass
- ‚úÖ ktlint formatting checks pass
- ‚úÖ No new compiler errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive inline documentation

### Build Status
- ‚úÖ Clean build successful
- ‚úÖ Debug APK builds successfully
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Documentation

### New Documentation Files
1. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Technical implementation details
2. **UI_FEATURES_GUIDE.md** - Visual guide with ASCII mockups and usage examples

### Documentation Content
- Feature descriptions with examples
- Usage instructions
- Testing guide
- Technical implementation details
- Visual mockups of all dialogs

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Better Information Access**: Players understand terrain effects before committing to moves
2. **Reduced Learning Curve**: Help dialog makes complex mechanics accessible
3. **Progression Feedback**: Clear visual celebration of character growth
4. **Strategic Planning**: Terrain info enables better tactical decisions
5. **Player Engagement**: Level up celebrations add excitement to battles

## Impact on Game Flow

### Before
- Players clicked tiles ‚Üí no feedback on terrain
- No in-game help available
- EXP gain was invisible to player
- Level ups happened silently

### After
- Click tiles ‚Üí see full terrain information
- Press long ‚Üí access comprehensive help
- After battles ‚Üí see EXP gained with progress bar
- On level up ‚Üí celebration dialog with stats

## Future Work (Out of Scope)

These features were mentioned in the issue but require dedicated implementation:

1. **Item Trading**: Needs inventory UI redesign
2. **Support System**: Needs new game mechanics
3. **Additional Map Layouts** (Set 4): Needs map design
4. **Tutorial Chapter** (Set 10): Needs dialogue system

## Testing Instructions

To test these features:

```bash
# Build the app
./gradlew assembleDevDebug

# Run tests
./gradlew testDevDebugUnitTest

# Install on device/emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/app-dev-debug.apk
```

In-game testing:
1. Start Chapter 1
2. Click empty tiles ‚Üí see terrain tooltips
3. Long-press ‚Üí select "Help" ‚Üí read game guide
4. Battle enemies ‚Üí observe EXP gain toast
5. Continue battling ‚Üí witness level up celebration

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are purely additive and don't affect existing functionality.

## Migration Guide

**Not required** - No API or data structure changes.
